These are the commands we'll use:
vi = Opens the VI editor to create a new text file or edit an existing text file
i = switch from command mode to insert mode
esc (the escape key) = switch from insert mode to command mode
w = write file (or save the file)
q = quit file (or close the file)
u = undo the last change
ctrl-r (hold the control key and press "r") = redo the last undone change

Let's start out by creating a new text file. The command is simple, it's just "vi <filename.extension>" So, if we want to create a file named Test.txt we type "vi Test.txt" and press Enter.

When we do that we're presented with a blank screen. In some editors, you can just start typing at this point, but VI has two modes, "Command" mode and "Insert" mode. When you're in "Command" mode you can do things like save the file or close the file.
