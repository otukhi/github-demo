These are the commands we'll use:
vi = Opens the VI editor to create a new text file or edit an existing text file
i = switch from command mode to insert mode
esc (the escape key) = switch from insert mode to command mode
w = write file (or save the file)
q = quit file (or close the file)
u = undo the last change
ctrl-r (hold the control key and press "r") = redo the last undone change

Let's start out by creating a new text file. The command is simple, it's just "vi <filename.extension>" So, if we want to create a file named Test.txt we type "vi Test.txt" and press Enter.

When we do that we're presented with a blank screen. In some editors, you can just start typing at this point, but VI has two modes, "Command" mode and "Insert" mode. When you're in "Command" mode you can do things like save the file or close the file. 


While the Republican leadership claims to be unified on the tax plan they must now sell it to
 lawmakers who have proven to be deeply divided this year. At a House retreat on Wednesday
 morning, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means 
 Committee, walked members through the framework and talked about the importance coming 
 together to fix the tax code.

 
 The plan aims to simplify and cut taxes for the middle class by doubling the standard 
 deduction to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples. That would allow 
 people to avoid a complicated process of itemizing their taxes to claim various credits
 and deductions. It would also increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to an unspecified
 amount and create a new $500 tax credit for dependents, such as the elderly, who are not 
 children.
